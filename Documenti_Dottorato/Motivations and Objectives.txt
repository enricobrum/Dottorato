The research on 5G network performance using the Firecell Labkit 2.1 is driven by several critical motivations, each aimed at addressing key aspects of the evolving 5G landscape. Firstly, advancing 5G technology is a primary motivation. With 5G networks promising substantial improvements in speed, capacity, and reliability, it is essential to thoroughly investigate these advancements in practical settings. The Firecell Labkit 2.1 offers a controlled environment for this exploration, enabling researchers to assess the network's capabilities and performance. Enhancing network performance is another crucial objective. As 5G networks are rolled out, ensuring optimal performance is vital for delivering high-quality service. By testing various scenarios—such as high traffic loads, mobility, Quality of Service (QoS), latency-sensitive applications, and interference—this research aims to identify performance bottlenecks and develop strategies to enhance network efficiency and reliability. Supporting private and lab-scale network deployments is also a significant motivation. Private 5G networks are increasingly important for organizations needing secure and customizable network solutions. The Firecell Labkit 2.1 facilitates the creation and testing of such networks, providing practical insights and best practices for successful implementation and management. The study also aims to bridge the gap between academic research and practical industry needs, fostering collaboration that drives the advancement of 5G technology. By addressing emerging challenges and contributing to industry standards, the research supports the creation of robust and efficient network architectures. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance user experience by ensuring that 5G networks deliver on their promises of high speed, low latency, and reliable connectivity. Through this comprehensive investigation, the research not only improves network performance but also provides actionable insights for future developments in the field.
