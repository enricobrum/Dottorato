This section details the experimental setup and methodology employed to deploy and test a 5G private network using the Firecell Labkit 2.1 release. The Firecell Labkit includes essential hardware components such as radio units that transmit and receive signals, baseband units that handle signal processing and connect to the core network, core network hardware comprising servers for running network functions, and user equipement like smatphones and IoT devices for testing network connectivity and performance. The software setup involves using Open Air Interface (OAI), an open-source software stack that implements 5G RAN (gNB) and core network (5GC) components. Docker is employed to containerize these components, ensuring isolated and consistent deployment. Kubernetes is used to orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and operation of the containerized OAI components. In addition, multiple Quectel EVB kits modules are used for testing the cellular network on third-part devices like personal computers, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino with Host USB Shield. 
To comprehensively analyze network performance, various test scenarios are defined. By the use of Iperf software, which allows generate traffic's network, various traffic load are generated. For each scenario, a Client-Server TCP application was used due to measure the network round trip time in order to compare the results to evaluate the impact of each test condition. In addition, to monitor network traffic to ensure correct data flow and troubleshoot any issues Wireshark was used.
