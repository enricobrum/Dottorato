IV - Real-World Setup

The experimental setup was designed to deploy and evaluate a private 5G network using the Firecell Labkit 40. This setup leveraged the open-source OpenAirInterface (OAI) project to implement the 5G architecture. The Radio Access Network (RAN) for New Radio (NR) was built using a gNB based on the USRP B200, configured via OAI and operating in the n78 frequency band.
User Equipement (UE) connectivity was provided by Quectel EVB modules equipped with preconfigured SIMs, integrated into the 5G system. An MSI PC running Windows 11 was equipped with three Quectel modules, esch configured as an Independent network node. Traffic generation was carried out using the iperf3 tool, where three iperf3 clients on the MSI PC directed traffic to three corresponding iperf3 servers, hosted on the Firecell Desktop PC. These servers were configured on distinct IP ports, enabling controlled traffic flow from each client. 
Additionally, a fourth Quectel mmodule was connected to a Windows 7 PC, which operated a Python-based client application. This client used NTP requests to retrive precise timestamps, t_send_client and t_recv_client, critical for measuring Round-Trip-Time and One-Way Trip Time (OTT), the metrics used to assess the system's performance. 
The Firecell Desktop PC also hosted a Python-based server application. This server, synchronized with the NTP service, collected complementary timestamp, t_send_server e t_recv_server, neccessary for the complete RTT and OTT calculations. By combining these measurements, the experimental setup enabled a detailed analysis of system performance under various traffic conditions, facilitated by the coordinated use of iperf3 traffic generators and precise time synchronization.
